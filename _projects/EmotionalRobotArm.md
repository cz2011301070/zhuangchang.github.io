**An interactive robot arm that responds to users' facial expressions by opening or closing its pose based on detected emotions.**

This project explores the integration of affective computing and robotics through a simple yet effective emotional response system. By leveraging real-time facial expression recognition, the robot arm interprets the user's emotional stateâ€”**happy** or **sad**â€”and adjusts its pose accordingly:

- ðŸ˜Š **Happy** â†’ Arm opens  
- ðŸ˜¢ **Sad** â†’ Arm closes

The system showcases the potential of emotionally intelligent machines, enabling more intuitive and human-centered interaction.

**Key Features**
- Real-time facial emotion detection using computer vision  
- Robotic control for expressive pose adaptation  
- Seamless human-robot interaction loop
