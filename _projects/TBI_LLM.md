This project builds upon a previous RAP-funded initiative, which focused on developing a Virtual Reality (VR) system aimed at rehabilitating individuals with cognitive fatigue resulting from traumatic brain injury (TBI). The previous work culminated in the creation of a virtual café, a simulated environment where TBI patients could relearn essential life skills in a realistic setting. The effectiveness of this VR tool was validated through a successful clinical trial involving 11 TBI clients and 13 clinicians. The trial demonstrated that clinicians could use the VR system to observe patients during therapy sessions, moving beyond reliance on client feedback or hypothetical scenarios. Additionally, it was found that the VR system was beneficial for a variety of therapeutic interventions and could be seamlessly integrated into clinical practice.

However, feedback from the trial indicated several areas for improvement to enhance clinical uptake and patient outcomes. The current project addresses these key changes:
Portability and Ease of Setup: To increase the clinical adoption of the VR system, it needs to be more user-friendly and transportable. This project will develop a stand-alone VR application that operates on self-contained VR headsets, eliminating the need for complex setups and making it easier to use in different clinical settings.

Enhanced Interaction with AI-Driven Characters: One significant piece of feedback from the initial trials was that the scripted interactions with virtual characters (playing the roles of friends and café staff) felt unnatural, limiting the transfer of skills from the VR environment to real life. To address this, we will integrate AI-driven virtual characters capable of engaging in natural conversations. This enhancement is expected to create a more immersive and effective therapeutic experience.
Customization Tools for Clinicians: To tailor the VR experience to individual patient needs, we will develop tools that allow clinicians to customize the therapy sessions. This customization will enable more targeted and effective rehabilitation interventions.

The existing TBI VR application will be restructured into a modular format, enhancing customization for a broader spectrum of treatments. To demonstrate this versatility, we will develop an additional experience: a virtual cafe scenario. 

The conversational system, designed in collaboration with our Iwi partners (IUE Ltd, He Waka Tapu), will undergo validation through user testing with therapists and clients from the Laura Ferguson Brain Injury Trust (LFBIT), continuing our co-design process. (Not development requirement)

In summary, this project aims to refine and enhance the existing VR rehabilitation system by making it more portable, improving the naturalness of interactions through AI, and providing clinicians with tools to customize therapy. These advancements will help ensure the VR system is more widely adopted and effective in rehabilitating individuals with TBI.
