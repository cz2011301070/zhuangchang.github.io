excerpt: 'Non-verbal cues like locomotion and posture influence users’ perceptions of Mixed Reality Agents (MiRAs). While Electroencephalography (EEG) captures cognitive responses, the influence of MiRAs’ locomotion and postures on brain activity remains underexplored. Additionally, few studies integrate subjective and behavioral measures with EEG to evaluate these cues’ impact on social perception. To address this, we conducted a within-subject study where participants played Gobang against three virtual agents in mixed reality: 1) a speech-only agent (S), 2) an embodied agent with speech and locomotion (S + L), and 3) an embodied agent with speech, locomotion, and posture (S + L + P). Results showed the S + L + P agent had higher engagement measured by the questionnaire but a lower EEG-based engagement index at AF3 than the S + L agent. Besides, the S + L + P was also rated higher in social presence, engagement, and emotional arousal than the S condition; No behavioral differences were observed. We discuss how MiRAs’ locomotion and posture affect users’ social perception and provide design implications for future human-agent interactions.'
