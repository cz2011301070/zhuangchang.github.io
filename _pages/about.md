Hi, I’m Zhuang Chang, a passionate researcher and developer working at the intersection of AI, virtual reality, and human-centered computing. I’m currently based in New Zealand, where I explore how emerging technologies can enhance collaboration, empathy, and interaction in immersive environments.

With a background in Mixed Reality and Virtual Agents, my work often blends design, programming, and research. I’m especially interested in:

🧠 Conversational AI and large language models

🎮 Virtual and mixed reality interfaces

📊 Physiological sensing and biofeedback

🤝 Human-agent collaboration

Outside of work, you’ll probably find me tinkering with Unity projects, reading about cognition and technology, or hiking trails with good views and bad Wi-Fi.
